        "IE requires polyfills to run an application that relies on ES2015 promises and dynamic module loading.
        Most applications need those capabilities and most applications should run in Internet Explorer."
        ref: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html

        "In web development, a polyfill (or polyfiller) is additional code which provides facilities that are not
        built into a web browser. It implements technology that a developer expects the browser to provide natively,
        providing a more uniform API landscape. For example, many features of HTML5 are not supported by versions of
        Internet Explorer older than version 8 or 9, but can be used by web pages if those pages install a polyfill.
        Web shims and HTML5 Shivs are related concepts."

    "RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. It provides
    one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired by
    Array#extras (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.
    Think of RxJS as lodash for events.
    ReactiveX combines the Observer pattern with the Iterator pattern and functional programming with collections
    to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events."
